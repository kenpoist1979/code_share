Hi

There are 3 example files for this portfolio. 

1. A terraform main file for a non-profit AWS cloud infrastructure I'm building.

2. A python patient program with mysql database as the backend. 

3. A non-profit student database I built with python with mongodb as the backend.

4. A trading api customize for private testing.
